= Dir listing translator

Having MS-DOS dir listing text file translate it to some language and make
translated list in excel/csv form.

== Problems
* tokenize names to be translated
* verify correctness of tokenizer
* make set of words to be translated
* make translated data
* create csv/excel file and macro to navigation

== Solution
* link:msdoslist.ebnf[EBNF MS-DOS dir listing definition]
* http://instaparse-live.matt.is/[Test tool for EBNF grammars]
* reduce data to set of words
- https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse[Fine library to use]
- ignore non ascii chars -> clojure program
* use that set to translate line by line
* save result to csv/excel file
